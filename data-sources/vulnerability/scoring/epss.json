  "description": "The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is a data-driven effort for estimating the likelihood (probability) that a software vulnerability will be exploited in the wild. EPSS is produced by FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams) and provides a probabilistic score between 0 and 1 (0 and 100%) representing the likelihood that a vulnerability will be exploited in the next 30 days. The model is built using the latest evidence from CVE and real-world exploit data.",
